Redux is a simple, truly extensible and fully responsive options framework for WordPress themes and plugins. Ships with an integrated demo.

== Description ==

Redux is a simple, truly extensible and fully responsive options framework for WordPress themes and plugins. Built on the WordPress Settings API, Redux supports a multitude of field types as well as: custom error handling, custom fields & validation types, and import/export functionality.

But what does Redux actually DO? We don't believe that theme and plugin
developers should have to reinvent the wheel every time they start work on a
project. Redux is designed to simplify the development cycle by providing a
streamlined, extensible framework for developers to build on. Through a
simple, well-documented config file, third-party developers can build out an
options panel limited only by their own imagination in a fraction of the time
it would take to build from the ground up!

= Online Demo =
Don't take our word for it, check out our online demo and try Redux without installing a thing!
[**http://demo.redux.io/**](http://demo.redux.io/)

= Use the Redux Builder to Get Started =
Want to use Redux, but not sure what to do? Use our [builder](http://build.reduxframework.com/)! It will allow you to make
a custom theme based on [_s](http://underscores.me), [TGM](http://tgmpluginactivation.com), and [Redux](http://reduxframework.com), and any Redux arguments you want to set.
Don't want to make your own theme? Then output a custom admin folder that you can place
in a theme or plugin. Oh and did we mention it's free? Try it today at:

We have extremely extensive docs.

We build off of the dev version and push to WordPress.org when all is confirmed stable and ready for release.
